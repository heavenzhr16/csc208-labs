# CSC208-Labs

Course labs done in Grinnell College CSC208-Discrete Structures

Course Description:
How do we “know” that a mathematical or logical statement is correct? What common properties appear among different collections? 
How might we represent functions, and how can we tell if two functions with different representations are the same? 
Can we formally describe and understand common diagrams? 
We consider such questions as we develop both intuition and formal mechanisms for addressing them. 
Along the way, we explore Boolean logic, proof techniques, sets, structures that include trees and graphs, and more.
